Welcome to housepoints.xyz!

I've been trying to find a way to reward my children and encourage good behavior. House Points is an app that encourages good behavior by awarding points (and possibly taking away points) for a variety of reasons.

They are awarded for the following reasons:

* Excellent Moral Fiber
* Excellent Conduct
* Punctuality
* Superb Behavior
* Respectful
* Helping Others
* Leadership
* Volunteering
* Responsible

However, they can be taken away as well.for the following reasons:

* Disrespectful
* Lying
* Stealing
* Cheating
* Fighting
* Bullying
* Teasing

Points are traked on a leaderboard, that show the total number of points that the kids have earned while the leaderboard is active.

This is still a work in progress. Send us an email if you are interested on hearing more. 

Thanks for checking us out!
